      <p> We provide maintenance and storage space. Choose the hosted version to start creating Walkthroughs right after login.  However, if your company policies or the nature of your business requires WalkHub to run on your own premises, choose the WalkHub On-Prem edition. </p>

      <p>WalkHub cares for your time. It automatically runs Walkthroughs to verify if a feature is still functional.
        Embed a widget of your steps’ screenshots to never have to worry about them again: they are updated
        automatically.</p>

        than a chore: it makes sure customers don't start doubting your docs — and eventually your product.</p>
