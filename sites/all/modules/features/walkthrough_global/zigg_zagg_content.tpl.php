      <h6>Reduce cognitive load</h6>

      <p><i>You will surely recognize this scenario: You are trying to accomplish a task on an online interface
          juggling your way through browser tabs, some written documentation or a video you constantly have to
          pause and rewind. </i></p>

      <p><strong>User guides and video tutorials</strong> are too complex and too sequential to offer users the
        help they need:
        They only <strong>increase users’ cognitive load</strong> because they have to switch back and forth
        between a window
        with the documentation (text or video) and the window in which they have the software open.
      </p>

      <p>
        We developed WalkHub to follow the way people actually do stuff online. Users get step by step
        instructions to accomplish their tasks without any distractions.
      </p>

      <p>
        We wanted to make our solution as intuitive as possible for Walkthrough creators as well. That is why,
        to create a Walkthrough, you record the process you want to share and document: simply click through a
        web site, fill in fields and submit forms. An initial description for steps is automatically generated -
        and if you have time, you can update them inline while playing the Walkthrough. </p>

      <h6>Keep your documentation up-to-date</h6>

      <p><i>If you have ever found yourself trying to decipher instructions from an outdated user manual, we bet you
          got more frustrated than trying it without a user guide at all. </i></p>

      <p>As anyone working in customer support can tell you, <strong>out of date documentation can be worse than
          having no
          documentation at all:</strong> screenshots and videos are the most important visual clues that inform a user
        if they
        are still on the right track. If the interface changes, and the screenshots aren’t updated, the user will be
        lost and confused.
      </p>

      <p>
        WalkHub automatically tests the process every time a Walkthrough is played. Not only do we check if the
        element you are interacting with is still present, but we also <strong>verify if the underlying user story
          still
          works.</strong>
        As a user you can be <strong>sure</strong> that the Walkthroughs will work and help you accomplish your
        tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each Walkthrough has an embeddable version: a widget created from screenshots of the Walkthrough’s steps.
        <strong>Screenshots in the widget are automatically updated</strong>, so you don’t have to worry about
        previously embedded
        widgets when editing a Walkthrough: they will always contain the most up-to-date information. </p>

      <h6>Reuse, share and collaborate</h6>

      <p><i>If you have ever had to rewrite a user guide and take new screenshots just because your software was used
          in a different environment, we guess you quickly ended up wishing for a reusable solution.</i></p>

      <p>Open source communities excel at sharing code, but are usually terrible at sharing documentation. We found
        that to get people to collaborate, a new tool had to be invented that makes it easy to <strong>create, reuse
          and
          share documentation between sites and projects.</strong> This tool is WalkHub. </p>

      <p>
        Walkthroughs are especially suited for making <strong>reusable chunks of content.</strong> They define a new
        format of
        tutorials that are strictly structured and that can easily be adapted to the visual context of a website. As
        a result it is much easier to <strong>reuse Walkthroughs between projects.</strong> WalkHub.net is also
        designed so that it
        could become the home of a range of community collections and their Walkthrough tutorials.
