BUILD A THEME WITH ZURB FOUNDATION
----------------------------------

The base Foundation theme is designed to be easily extended by its sub-themes.
You shouldn't modify any of the CSS or PHP files in the zurb_foundation/ folder;
but instead you should create a sub-theme of zurb_foundation which is located in
a folder outside of the root zurb_foundation/ folder. The examples below assume
zurb_foundation and your sub-theme will be installed in sites/all/themes/,
but any valid theme directory is acceptable. Read the
sites/default/default.settings.php for more info.

This theme does not support IE7. If you need it downgrade to Foundation 2 see
http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/faq.php or use the script in the starter
template.php THEMENAME_preprocess_html function.

*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
*
* In Drupal 7, the theme system caches which template files and which theme
* functions should be called. This means that if you add a new theme,
* preprocess or process function to your template.php file or add a new template
* (.tpl.php) file to your sub-theme, you will need to rebuild the "theme
* registry." See http://drupal.org/node/173880#theme-registry
*
* Drupal 7 also stores a cache of the data in .info files. If you modify any
* lines in your sub-theme's .info file, you MUST refresh Drupal 7's cache by
* simply visiting the Appearance page at admin/appearance or at
  admin/config/development/performance.

BUILD A THEME WITH DRUSH
----------------------------------
If you have drush and the zurb foundation theme enabled you can create a
subtheme easily with a drush.

The command to do this is simply:
  drush fst [THEMENAME] [Description !Optional]

MANUALLY BUILD A THEME
----------------------------------
 1. Setup the location for your new sub-theme.

    Copy the STARTER folder out of the zurb_foundation/ folder and rename it to
    be your new sub-theme. IMPORTANT: The name of your sub-theme must start with
    an alphabetic character and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers and
    underscores.

    For example, copy the sites/all/themes/zurb_foundation/STARTER folder and
    rename it as sites/all/themes/foo.

      Why? Each theme should reside in its own folder. To make it easier to
      upgrade Foundation, sub-themes should reside in a folder separate from the
      base theme.

 2. Setup the basic information for your sub-theme.

    In your new sub-theme folder, rename the STARTERKIT.info.txt file to include
    the name of your new sub-theme and remove the ".txt" extension. Then edit
    the .info file by editing the name and description field.

    For example, rename the foo/STARTER.info.txt file to foo/foo.info. Edit the
    foo.info file and change "name = Foundation Sub-theme Starter" to
    "name = Foo" and "description = Read..." to "description = A sub-theme".

      Why? The .info file describes the basic things about your theme: its
      name, description, features, template regions, CSS files, and JavaScript
      files. See the Drupal 7 Theme Guide for more info:
      http://drupal.org/node/171205

    Then, visit your site's Appearance page at admin/appearance to refresh
    Drupal 7's cache of .info file data.

 3. Edit your sub-theme to use the proper function names.

    Edit the template.php and theme-settings.php files in your sub-theme's
    folder; replace ALL occurrences of "STARTER" with the name of your
    sub-theme.

    For example, edit foo/template.php and foo/theme-settings.php and replace
    every occurrence of "STARTER" with "foo".

    It is recommended to use a text editing application with search and
    "replace all" functionality.

 5. Set your website's default theme.

    Log in as an administrator on your Drupal site, go to the Appearance page at
    admin/appearance and click the "Enable and set default" link next to your
    new sub-theme.


Optional steps:

 6. Modify the markup in Foundation core's template files.

    If you decide you want to modify any of the .tpl.php template files in the
    zurb_foundation folder, copy them to your sub-theme's folder before
    making any changes.And then rebuild the theme registry.

    For example, copy zurb_foundation/templates/page.tpl.php to
    THEMENAME/templates/page.tpl.php.

 7. Modify the markup in Drupal's search form.

    Copy the search-block-form.tpl.php template file from the modules/search/
    folder and place it in your sub-theme's template folder. And then rebuild
    the theme registry.

    You can find a full list of Drupal templates that you can override in the
    templates/README.txt file or http://drupal.org/node/190815

      Why? In Drupal 7 theming, if you want to modify a template included by a
      module, you should copy the template file from the module's directory to
      your sub-theme's template directory and then rebuild the theme registry.
      See the Drupal 7 Theme Guide for more info: http://drupal.org/node/173880

 8. Further extend your sub-theme.
